                <p>If you are reading this and starting or completing your first year of Software Engineering, welcome aboard!
                    Your first year will contain classic and core engineering courses that are common across all engineering programs. 
                    The only difference though is that <strong>Software, Computer and Electrical Engineers</strong> have to take 
                    <strong>EECS 1028 </strong>, the rest <strong>(Mechanical, Civil and Space)</strong> will have to take
                    <strong>ESSE 1012</strong> in their first year.

                    MATLAB (short for Matrix Laboratory). This course also assumes you never programmed before. You may be asked
                    to buy an Arduino Uno kit for the final project you'll be assigned
                    at the end of the course. I personally have never used MATLAB after
                    I finished this course. Despite that, if you've never coded before,
                    I would advise you to learn the coding fundamentals (variables, scoping,
                    loops, etc.) for future courses.

                    touches on differential calculus, which is basically review
                    from high school calculus. Though, you may learn a few new topics
                    and concepts (including a little bit on 
                    integrals in MATH 1014). If you've taken AP or IB calculus, the course

                    This is your first (and probably last) chemistry course in
                    the program. I mostly found this course to be easier than my grade
                    12 chemistry class, part of it due to having no organic chemistry.
                    This course requires practice and memorization to do well.
                    You also will do chemistry lab experiments involving
                    titration, polymers, analyzing equilibriums and chemical reactions, 
                    ferrofluids, and more. The nice thing about this course is that you can take it anytime, since
                    it's not a prerequisite to any mandatory future courses. If you are 
                    looking to do a lighter course load in your second semester of your
                    first year, CHEM 1100 is your pick to opt out for now. 
                    Generally, your 2nd semester is harder than the 1st, because of new content that
                    you have never learned in high school, which will be common in 2nd year
                    and beyond. Though, it would be nice to get over it soon as you can, since
                    it may not be offered every semester or you forget most of your chemistry

                    a bit difficult to get used to coming from only knowing MATLAB or

                    future courses such as electrical circuits, digital logic design, etc.
                    You will also be mostly using the breadboard with software

                    if your breadboard isn't working the way it's supposed to after
                    tinkering with it for a while, so you don't burn time during your lab.

                <p id="eecs1028" class="course-content">
                    Let me introduce you to the most infamous course to every first
                    year EECS engineering student. The primary reason this is difficult
                    is because it's different from the computational or plug-n-chug
                    courses you've been doing previously. It is about proofs, which
                    most students struggle with at first. Try to get a decent professor, work
                    with a group of friends, understand the concepts 
                    and practice, practice, practice to succeed. Ideally, try to get this course
                    done before you start your 2nd year. I dropped it in my 2nd semester in first year,
                    but then I retook it with a different professor in the summer and got a decent grade, 
                    without tanking my EECS GPA. It's also
                    a crucial course that requires you to write proofs and know logic
                    for useful courses like EECS 2101 (Data Structures). Another reason 
                    why it's hard because you may be required to learn exclusive concepts
                    taught from course notes and unavailable online to self-learn. I
                    however took the course in the summer where we used a regular
                    published discrete mathematics textbook, instead of foreign
                    course notes. Here is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz"
