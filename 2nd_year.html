                <p>Congrats on surviving first year! First year might have been a breeze for some people, but second year will definitely humble 
                   most people, as it happened to me. The majority of your classes will shared with Computer and Electrical Engineers, as they still
                   have some more core courses to do. This will be a bumpy year so buckle up!</p>
             
                <h3 class="arrow" onclick="toggleCourseContent('eecs2030', this)"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right arrow-icon"></i> EECS 2030 - Advanced OOP</h3>
                <p id="eecs2030" class="course-content">
                    This is the predecessor course for EECS 1021. You will touch on advanced (also very 
                    important) OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and composition,
                    shallow copy and deep copy, interfaces, abstract classes, etc. I would take this course
                    ASAP because it unlocks many courses in 2nd year and beyond, that require EECS 2030 as 
                    a prerequisite.

                <p id="eecs2021" class="course-content">
                    One of my favourite 2nd year courses. In this course, you will learn topics related to both hardware, such as gates, memory, and number systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal),
                    and software, including operating systems, compilers, and assemblers, as well as their interfaces.
                    You will also learn assembly programming, using RISC-V and hardware description languages like Verilog. 
                    It's a vital course if you want to look into fields like embdedded systems, frimware design, FPGAs, etc. Be warned that 
                    this course is time consuming and I would recommend spending a good amount of time for this course. By the way, Verilog will
                    come back in third year courses like EECS 3201 and EECS 3216 (though they will assume you know nothing), 
                    so I would at least have an idea of the basics of Verilog. Verilog is important to learn for Electrical and
                    Computer Engineers, and less applicable for Software Engineers unless if you want to
                    involve yourself into hardware.

                <p id="eecs2200" class="course-content">
                    I have never been so glad to pass a course and never have to retake ever again.
                    This course is all about analyzing and solving electrical circuits, beyond what you learned in PHYS 1801. 
                    I personally think this is the hardest course in second year, because you need to have a unique approach to solving circuit problems.
                    You have to understand HOW a circuit works to be able to solve problems, rather than just throwing formulas all around and solving a 
                    physics problem. Moreover, you have to master the basics of circuits: how voltage, current and resistance works, Kirchhoff's Laws,
                    how to tell if resistors are in series, parallel or neither, etc. The good news though is it's not a prerequisite to many courses
                    (except for EECS 3452 if you decide to go into the General stream), so you may take it later.
                    I found this course with little purpose for SE, but this would be how SE would be accredited by the CEAB. I highly recommend taking this course
                    in the summer if you have time and get it over with. Learning ahead for this course would also be a good idea, here is a good

                    The final calculus course in SE. I found this to be significantly easier than integral calculus because of
                    the heavy overlap between differential calculus, integral calculus and linear algebra. The transition from MATH 1014 is
                    smoother than going from MATH 1013 to MATH 1014. However, you will have to know your linear
                    algebra well from MATH 1025, since you will work in 3D or multi-dimensions.

                    This is supposed to be the lab component for PHYS 2020, but it's split into a single 1.0 credit course.
                    The only work you have to do are prelab quizzes before the lab and the lab experiments in the lab. The experiments are similar to the 
                    ones done in PHYS 1801 labs.

                    You will be put into a group throughout the semester of this course, developing a software project
                    mostly in Java and the stuff you learned from EECS 2030. Make sure you find a group that you they
                    willing to do above the minimum. I also recommend learning Git, databases with SQL and using Github before taking this course,
                    don't wait until the class covers them (I made this mistake). It also covers common and important SE practices in the industry like testing,
                    code reviews, user stories, agile software development, etc. I wish I learned Git and databases ahead of time, I could've gotten a better grade 
                    and learned a lot more.            
                    <br/><br/>
                    Difficulty: course difficultly depends on group as well, but typically should be 6/10.

                <p id="math1090" class="course-content">
                    Imagine if EECS 1028 is a bag of potato chips. Then you have this other bag of chips with a weird and unique flavor
                    (like cucumber or whatever), that is MATH 1090. You will learn about boolean and first order logic in a completely new
                    abstract syntax as opposed to EECS 1028. Keep in mind that it's also a unique course offered by York, so universities don't cover
                    this particular course content (even other professors like to roast it or despise teaching it). Though the content in the course seem useless, it's however essential 
                    to have a decent understanding of this course for third year courses like EECS 3342. Otherwise, I
                    see it as a filler course for CE and CS students. One important thing to note that EECS 1028 is not a prerequisite to MATH 1090.
                    However EECS 1019, which is discrete math for CS is indeed a prerequisite for MATH 1090. Therefore, I personally recommned taking
                    EECS 1028 first, so MATH 1090 has an easier learning curve for you.
